# Kafka-Net
This is the code used in my Kafka For .NET Developers presentation (http://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/kafka/).

To get the flight data we loaded and the airport data we used to enrich our data sets, check out the Data expo '09 contest's set of 
flight data (http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html), including the 2008 flight data (http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/2008.csv.bz2)
and airports CSV file (http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/airports.csv).
